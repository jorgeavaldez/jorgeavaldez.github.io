to boss around computers. Here are some of the ones I
like to use.</div><div id="java" class="description"> <div id="langSub">Java</div>I have been programming in Java for 5 years now,
starting my freshman year of high school. I have
competition experience, attending HP CodeWars, as
well as participating in Texas UIL competition. I
have a working knowledge of various algorithm and
data structure implementations in Java, as well as
most of the standard libraries.</div><div id="python" class="description"> <div id="langSub">Python</div>One of my top favorite languages. My first exposure
to this language came about 3 years ago, when I decided
to write a small little program to help me with my physics
homework. I have experience writing small web scrapers
(to download images from websites), as well as math tools,
CLI tools, natural language processing, and even a Raspberry
Pi camera booth that plays Mad-Libs.</div><div id="javascript" class="description"> <div id="langSub">Javascript/Coffeescript</div>I'm currently a Javascript novice. I tend to use
Coffeescript, as it leads to cleaner code, and the syntax
reminds me of Python <3. My first foray into the depths of
the language came this year at HackTX, a hackathon at UT
Austin, where I made use of Socket.IO to write a hybrid 
mobile web-app that allowed people to draw on their 
televisions using DirecTV boxes.</div><div id="cpp" class="description"> <div id="langSub">C++</div>C++ is one of the languages that I hated from the beginning,
but am quickly growing fond of. I first started using this
language this year, as one of the introductory programming
courses I was required to take. I am currently taking a
Data Structures and Algorithms course where we are learning
to love the language. Pointers and memory-management are
starting to become some of my favorite concepts.</div></div></body></html>
